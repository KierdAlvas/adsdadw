            <h2>Redline and Sound:</h2> <p>This V10 engine has a high redline of 10,000 rpm, delivering an exhilarating sound that resembles a Formula 1 engine from the early 2000s, adding an authentic motorsport experience.</p>
                <h2>Top Speed:</h2> <p>The Solus GT is estimated to have a top speed exceeding 200 mph (322 km/h).</p>
                    <h2>Acceleration:</h2> <p>It can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 100 km/h) in around 2.5 seconds, delivering breathtaking launch power.</p>
        <h1>3. Transmission and Drivetrain</h1>
        <h2>Gearbox:</h2> <p>The Solus GT utilizes a seven-speed sequential racing transmission, which is lightweight and built for quick gear changes, enhancing the car’s performance and responsiveness on the track.</p>
        <h2>Rear-Wheel Drive:</h2> <p>The car is rear-wheel drive, which is typical for McLaren’s design philosophy, giving it a pure driving experience that rewards skillful control on the track.</p>
        <h1>4. Chassis and Suspension</h1>
        <h2>Carbon-Fiber Monocoque:</h2> <p>The chassis is built using a carbon-fiber monocoque, ensuring rigidity and safety while maintaining a low weight for optimal performance. The car’s weight is kept under 2,205 lbs (1,000 kg), allowing for agile handling.</p>
        <h2>Suspension:</h2> <p>The Solus GT is equipped with double-wishbone suspension on both the front and rear, paired with inboard, pushrod-actuated dampers. This setup provides precise handling, allowing the car to corner at high speeds with confidence and stability.</p>
        <h2>Brakes:</h2> <p>Carbon-ceramic brakes ensure strong, consistent stopping power, even under intense track conditions. The braking system is designed to withstand the high speeds and aggressive braking typical of track racing.</p>
        <h2>Aerodynamic Downforce:</h2> <p>The car is capable of generating over 2,645 lbs (1,200 kg) of downforce, more than its own weight, enhancing grip and cornering capability. This level of downforce is comparable to GT3 race cars, ensuring it can handle intense track conditions.</p>
       <h1> 5. Interior and Driver Experience</h1>
        <h2>Single-Seat Cockpit:</h2> <p>The Solus GT has a central, single-seat configuration that places the driver at the heart of the car, similar to a Formula 1 or Le Mans prototype car. This layout is designed to give the driver an immersive and focused experience.</p>
        <h2>Customizable Seat and Controls:</h2> <p>The seat is custom-fitted to the driver, and controls are positioned for maximum ergonomics. McLaren offers a custom steering wheel with integrated controls, allowing drivers to manage various car functions without taking their hands off the wheel.</p>
        <h2>Minimalist Design:</h2> <p>The interior is designed to be minimalistic and purely functional, with only essential elements included. The design focuses on reducing weight and maximizing driver engagement.</p>
        <h2>Digital Display:</h2> <p>A digital screen behind the steering wheel provides all necessary information, including speed, lap times, and vehicle diagnostics, ensuring the driver has clear visibility of critical data.</p>
        <h1>6. Technology and Engineering Innovations</h1>
