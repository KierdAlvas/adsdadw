Named after the company’s founder, Battista “Pinin” Farina, this hypercar marks Pininfarina's debut as an automaker and represents a blend of Italian craftsmanship, cutting-edge electric technology, and extreme performance. Developed in collaboration with Rimac Automobili, the Battista shares its powertrain technology with the Rimac Nevera but brings its own unique design and Italian elegance to the hypercar category. Here are the full details:</p>

    <h1>1. Design and Exterior</h1>
        <h2>Body Style:</h2> <p>The Battista is a two-door, two-seat hypercar with a low, sculpted profile emphasizing Italian luxury and performance.</p>
        <h2>Aerodynamics:</h2> <p>The car’s design is focused on aerodynamic efficiency. Active aero elements, including an adaptive rear wing and diffuser, provide adjustable downforce to improve stability and handling at high speeds. The elegant, flowing lines optimize airflow around the car, reducing drag.</p>
        <h2>Materials:</h2> <p>The Battista’s body and chassis are constructed primarily from lightweight carbon fiber to minimize weight and maximize performance.</p>
        <h2>Lighting:</h2> <p>The car features ultra-thin LED lighting, with a continuous light bar that spans the rear, providing a sleek, futuristic look. The headlights and taillights are designed to enhance the car’s Italian aesthetic while adding modern flair.</p>
        <h2>Customizable Exterior:</h2> <p>Pininfarina offers extensive customization options, including bespoke paint colors, finishes, and carbon-fiber options, allowing owners to personalize the car’s appearance to their tastes.</p>
        <h1>2. Powertrain and Performance</h1>
        <h2>Electric Motors:</h2> <p>The Battista is powered by four electric motors, one for each wheel, creating an advanced all-wheel-drive system. This setup allows for precise torque vectoring, where each wheel can receive a specific amount of power depending on driving conditions.</p>
        <h2>Total Output:</h2> <p>The Battista produces a combined 1,900 horsepower (1,397 kW) and 1,696 lb-ft (2,300 Nm) of torque, making it one of the most powerful electric hypercars in the world.</p>
        <h2>Transmission:</h2> <p>The car uses a single-speed transmission that delivers seamless and instantaneous power across its entire speed range.</p>
        <h2>Top Speed:</h2> <p>The Battista can reach a top speed of 217 mph (350 km/h).</p>
        <h2>Acceleration:</h2> <p>It accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in under 2 seconds and can achieve 0 to 186 mph (0 to 300 km/h) in less than 12 seconds. This incredible acceleration places it among the fastest-accelerating road-legal cars.</p>
        <h1>3. Battery and Electric Range</h1>
        <h2>Battery Pack:</h2> <p>The Battista is equipped with a 120 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, positioned low and centrally within the monocoque chassis for optimal weight distribution and handling. The battery is developed by Rimac, known for their expertise in electric powertrains.</p>
        <h2>Range:</h2> <p>The Battista has an estimated range of up to 310 miles (500 km) on a single charge under WLTP testing conditions, impressive for a hypercar with this level of performance.</p>
        <h2>Charging:</h2> <p>The car supports fast charging, allowing the battery to charge from 20% to 80% in around 25 minutes when using a 180 kW DC fast charger.</p>
        <h1>4. Chassis and Handling</h1>
        <h2>Carbon-Fiber Monocoque:</h2> <p>The Battista features a full carbon-fiber monocoque structure that integrates the battery, reducing weight and enhancing structural rigidity for improved handling and safety.</p>
        <h2>Suspension:</h2> <p>It has a double-wishbone suspension system with electronically adjustable dampers, allowing drivers to switch between comfort and performance modes based on their preferences and road conditions.</p>
        <h2>All-Wheel Drive:</h2> <p>The Battista’s all-wheel-drive system with torque vectoring distributes power to each wheel independently, providing exceptional traction, agility, and stability, especially in corners.</p>
        <h2>Brakes:</h2> <p>Carbon-ceramic brakes with six-piston calipers offer strong stopping power, which is essential for a car with the Battista’s level of speed. The car also uses regenerative braking, which helps recharge the battery and provides additional stopping power.</p>
        <h1>5. Interior and Technology</h1>
        <h2>Interior Design:</h2> <p>The Battista’s cabin is a blend of luxury and technology, crafted with high-quality materials such as leather, Alcantara, and carbon fiber. The layout is driver-focused, with controls and displays arranged for optimal ergonomics.</p>
        <h2>Infotainment and Displays:</h2> <p>The Battista features three digital screens—a central infotainment screen and two side screens—that provide the driver with essential information, including performance data, navigation, and multimedia options. The central display serves as the main interface, while the side displays focus on supplementary data.</p>
        <h2>Personalization:</h2> <p>Automobili Pininfarina offers extensive customization for the Battista’s interior, with choices of materials, colors, and finishes that allow owners to create a truly unique vehicle. Owners can even select custom engravings and bespoke badging.</p>
        <h2>Sound System:</h2> <p>The Battista comes equipped with a high-end sound system, designed to offer a premium audio experience that matches the car’s luxury profile.</p>
